<h1>Movie Recommender System</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to implement a recommendation system on movies, to output movies similar to the input movie and to predict the ratings that a user will give to an unseen movie. This is made possible by implementing an item-item collaborative filtering recommender system, where predictions are made based on past movie-user ratings and similar movies. This recommender system is run by performing a supervised machine learning algorithm, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and evaluated by testing its root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and recall coverage. As a result, the item-item collaborative filtering movie recommender system performed with a low RMSD and a high recall coverage. Our findings suggest that the movie recommendation model we have built works well. We found out that the system suggests very similar movies based on the user's information. Consequently, not only is it just a movie recommendation system, but it's also convenient for a movie producer to plan a new movie. The experiment results obtained on the MovieLens dataset stipulate that the planned approach could give high performance concerning reliability, potency and deliver correct personalised show recommendations compared with existing methods.
